# Alfred-public
*Applaunch.workflow* - a very basic workflow to start my work apps, wait a few secs and then call a moom keyboard shortcut to arrange the apps.
This will require customising of the apps you want to start and whatever keyboard shortcut you have set in Moom.

Also in this workflow is my open and hide Spotify keyboard shortcut.
